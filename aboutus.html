    <h3>About DIET Srinagar</h3>
    <a name="aboutdietsgr"></a>
      <p class="aboutus_p">
        DIET is the most significant educational intervention in the country, while the NCERT came up in the 1960’s and the State Councils of Education Research and Training came up in 1970’s, the need for a third tier of training and resource support structure, right at the district level was genuinely felt in order to improve the quality of basic education. As result DIET’s were set up in almost all the districts of all the states in the country.Govt. of India gave top priority to elementary education. Different education commissions were constituted which submitted their reports and on the basis of their findings, Govt. made drastic change in the education policy. In the beginning education was a state subject but through an amendment in the constitution in 1976 the subject of education was put on the concurrent list. As a result State Govt. as well as Central Govt. now collectively frame a particular education policy & National Education Policy 1986, introduced a new pattern of education know as 10+2+3 system. Establishment of DIET’s is based on the recommendations of National Education Policy 1986.District Institute of Education and Training, Hatta was established in Oct.1988 by converting Junior Basic Training School which was set up on 01-01-1973. The sole purpose of DIET is to conduct different kinds of trainings programmes to improve the quality of basic education and create a desirable environment within the district in regard to enroll more and more children of school going age and pave the way for retention of those who are admitted in the school and to ensure the high literacy percentage of male and female as whole.

      <h3>Our Objectives</h3>
      <p class="aboutus_p">
        “The Aim of Education is the knowledge not of facts but of values.”<br>
        In the heart of dedicated professionals is the belief that the primary goal of education is student achievement. The objective of education is to turn the eyes, which the soul already possesses, to light. The whole function of education is not to put knowledge in the soul but to bring out the best things that are latent in the soul.What strategies would bring about greatest student achievement and improved outcome in our system needs to be viewed in order to maximize student learning and to implement collaborative experimental student-centered cognitive approaches.A focused approach on this shifting paradigm from teaching to learning and making the teacher a facilitator is the demand of the hour. We, at DIET COLLEGE, firmly believe that without change something sleeps inside us and seldom awakens.<br>
        <ul id="obj_list">
          <li>To Provide high level of education and knowledge to students.</li>
          <li>To Provide information of new and upcoming technologies to the student</li>
          <li> To Encourage students for research and development.</li>
          <li>To Provide career guidance through eminent personalities from academics and industries.</li>
          <li>To Organize seminars, guest lectures, industrial training for the student.</li>
          <li>To develop personality and inculcate practical knowledge among students</li>
        </ul>

      <h3>Our Mission</h3>
      <p class="aboutus_p">
        The Education Commission (1964-66) had observed that “of all the factors that influences the quality of education ....the quality; competence & character of the teachers are undoubtedly the most significance”. But these in turn depends substantially on the quality of training and other support provided to them. Until adoption of NPE this support in the area of Elementary Education was being provided largely at National and State level only by Institution like NCERT, NIEPA & SCERTs. Likewise in the area of Adult Education, this support was being provided by the Central Directorate of Adult Education at the national level and the State ResourceCenters (SRCs) at the state level. Below the state level there are Elementary Teacher Education Institutions but their activities were confined mostly to Pre-Service teacher education. Thus their roles were limited. There were larger problems like outdated teaching practice & course of study.By the time of adoption of NPE, Elementary and Adult Education System were too vast to be adequately supported by National and State level agencies alone. Therefore NPE accordingly envisaged addition of third district level tier to support the system in the shape of DIETs in every district of the country. With the introduction of this third layer of support system expectation would be of wider quantitative and hopefully qualitative coverage as DIETs would be closer to the field and therefore more alive to the problems and needs.<br><strong>The mission of the DIETs is to provide academic and resource support to the grass root level for the success of the various strategies and programme being undertaken in the areas of elementary & Adult Education.</strong>
