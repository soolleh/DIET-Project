   DIET is the most significant educational intervention in the country, while the NCERT came up in the 1960’s and the state councils of education research and training came up in 1970’s, the need for a third tier of training and resource support structure, right at the district level was genuinely felt in order to improve the quality of basic education. As result DIET’s were set up in almost all the districts of all the states in the country. Government of India gave top priority to elementary education. Different education commissions were constituted  which submitted their reports and on the basis of their findings, Govt. made drastic change in the education policy. In the beginning education was a state subject but through an amendment in the constitution in 1976 the subject of education was put on the concurrent list. As a result state Govt. as well as central Govt. now collectively frame a particular education policy & national education policy 1986, introduced a new pattern of education know as 10+2+3 system. Establishment of DIET’s is based on the recommendations of national education policy 1986.District Institute of Education and Training, Srinagar was established in Oct 1988.
